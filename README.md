# flights-disruptions-sql
Hello,

here is my SQL project i made in school it is based on Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
here you find a link to download the database: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NBqcdW778CqDBfTk35EfxUV1_W2mhJi2/view?usp=sharing">db-flights</a>
and a link for the exercice questions: <a href="https://github.com/fawzibazari/flights-disruptions-sql/blob/main/ProjetTraficAerien.docx
">exercice</a>
<br>

So basically what i do here is sql querys to analyze the data from the db

## Also i did make a schema of the db for clarification üòÅ:

## improvements

1. add primary key for flights table

2. be more specify with types for columns
